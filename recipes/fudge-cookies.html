      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat together the eggs and sugar until light and creamy. Add in the
          chocolate extract and mix again.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Add the dry ingredients to the wet and, using a spatula, mix to
          combine. Just go slow as it will come together. If desired, you can
          use a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the dry and wet and almost fully incorporated, add in the melted
          butter and mix to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dump in the marshmallow bits and the mini chips. Use a spatula to
          combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grab the frozen marshmallows and slice in half (if not already
          sliced). Using a large cookie scoop, scoop up about 3 tablespoon of
          cookie dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          With damp hands, place the cookie dough into your hand and make an
          indent in the middle pressing the dough outwards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place half of a frozen marshmallow into the cookie well/indent and
          then form the rest of the dough around the marshmallow, closing it up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the cookie dough on the prepared baking sheet and repeat adding
          more cookie dough balls 2â€³ apart.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 11-14 minutes or until the cookie is set but still slightly
          soft. They will firm up while cooling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow the cookies to rest on the tray for at least 10 minutes before
          transferring them to a cooling rack.
        </li>
